// Will have a main/section that is always visible (default is tracked?) and expandable, which includes the rest of the relevant classfeatures as listed in ClassesData
// Subclass Features, Racial Features, and additional features (Feats, magic items, custom features, etc) will have their own sections/columns on the mainUI
